I recently moved away from a literate config managed by `config.org` to a modularized approach. I have plans to soon [detangle](https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/45164/does-org-have-any-inverse-tangle-operations-e-g-for-collaborating-with-non-or) my config for the benefit of providing this repository a README.
